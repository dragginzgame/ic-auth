# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Breaking

- Rename the types package to `ic-auth-protocol-types` to avoid the existing,
  unrelated `ic_auth_types` crate on crates.io. Consumers must update their Cargo
  dependency and Rust imports to `ic_auth_protocol_types`; Candid contracts and
  signed bytes are unchanged. Update release and publication tooling to use
  the renamed package. [#1](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth/issues/1)

The maintainer selected `0.1.2` for this rename as an exception to the usual
pre-1.0 minor increment for breaking changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-08

- Add standard patch, minor and major releases with recoverable metadata
  preparation and atomic branch/tag delivery, plus crates.io publication and
  a publication dry run that verifies package builds without uploading.

- Bootstrap the unpublished Rust workspace with shared setup, formatting hooks,
  locked validation and CI configuration.

  [Canic #491](https://github.com/dragginzgame/canic/issues/491).
