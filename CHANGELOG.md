# Changelog

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-08

- Add optional complete application-token verification: authenticate root
  chain-key grants and issuer signatures, bind the actual caller, and enforce
  protected audience, role, scope, lifetime and authority policy on every call.
  Preserve existing signed bytes and keep verification free of wallet, host
  tooling and storage dependencies. Session admission/replay remain separate.
- Isolate parallel native-tooling test fixtures even when macOS clock readings
  coincide, preventing one test's input from replacing another's evidence.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-08

- Add optional IC canister-signature verification with protected signer, seed
  and network trust inputs, bounded proof decoding and host-controlled certificate
  freshness. Use DFINITY's cryptography; preserve Canic's signed domains.
  Complete token verification and session admission remain pending.
- Adopt Shared Tooling 0.1.25, including final release/tag rechecks, hardened
  evidence archive paths and
  confirmed remote-tracking reconciliation. Use published `ic-host-fs` and
  `ic-host-artifacts` for bounded file identities and durable publication
  evidence. Encoding-only dependency graphs and signed-byte contracts are unchanged.

- Configure the complete CI gate on Linux and macOS Intel/Apple Silicon,
  with retained failure evidence. Native macOS qualification awaits those jobs.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-08

### Breaking

- Rename the types package to `ic-auth-protocol-types` to avoid the existing,
  unrelated `ic_auth_types` crate on crates.io. Consumers must update their Cargo
  dependency and Rust imports to `ic_auth_protocol_types`; Candid contracts and
  signed bytes are unchanged. Update release and publication tooling to use
  the renamed package. [#1](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth/issues/1)

The maintainer selected `0.1.2` for this rename as an exception to the usual
pre-1.0 minor increment for breaking changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-08

- Add standard patch, minor and major releases with recoverable metadata
  preparation and atomic branch/tag delivery, plus crates.io publication and
  a publication dry run that verifies package builds without uploading.

## [0.1.0]

Initial bootstrap recorded in commit
[`7a03102`](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth/commit/7a03102e52b7a400588530997a9f7fb91c83de9d)
on 2026-10-08; this version was not tagged or published.

- Bootstrap the unpublished Rust workspace with shared setup, formatting hooks,
  locked validation and CI configuration.
- Introduce passive application-token contracts and canonical encoding adapted
  from Canic, preserving existing Candid identities and signed hash vectors.
  Full verification, sessions and wallet login remain pending under
  [Canic #491](https://github.com/dragginzgame/canic/issues/491).
