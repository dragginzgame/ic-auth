# Current handoff — 2026-10-08

The maintainer accepted the larger Canic authentication extraction, selected the
name `ic-auth`, and confirmed `/home/adam/projects/ic-auth` as the local repository.

The committed bootstrap is `7a03102e52b7a400588530997a9f7fb91c83de9d` (`0.1.0`) on
`main`; the remote branch was verified at that same commit during this batch.
The public remote [dragginzgame/ic-auth](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth)
was created at the maintainer's request and is configured as `origin` using
`https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth.git`.
The accepted [design](../design/extraction.md) covers signatures, application
tokens and local sessions, plus an independent Solana wallet-auth service.
[Canic #491](https://github.com/dragginzgame/canic/issues/491) remains the existing
extraction and Canic adoption tracker. New IC Auth-specific issues belong in
the public repository's issue tracker.
The [bootstrap evidence comment](https://github.com/dragginzgame/canic/issues/491#issuecomment-6055817375)
records this batch without closing the larger extraction.

The virtual Rust workspace now contains `ic-auth-types` and `ic-auth`, with one
lockfile, root-owned dependency selections and initial local version `0.1.0`.
The passive token/proof contracts and canonical encoding are adapted from the
clean Canic source at `e286b3fd98460c98670336853f80658a920966e0`; see the
[source review](../design/canic-source-review.md) for exact ownership and API
adaptations. Both packages now allow crates.io publication of their implemented
contracts/encoding, with inherited repository/README metadata and matching MIT
notices in the package payloads. They remain unpublished. There is no token verifier,
session engine, wallet endpoint or TypeScript client yet. Canic adoption has not
occurred; no sibling repository was modified.

The engineering snapshot contains 58 committed Shared Tooling files from
`2687f26317952c43c685f7f799ed09288dc10a67`. It was exported from a clean temporary
clone, preserving the source checkout's unrelated uncommitted work. The snapshot
verifier passed during installation. The expanded snapshot supplies shared
Make/tool setup, formatter hook and focused governance helpers. Pinned host,
Rust and IC tools are installed in this checkout and `make tools-check` passed
on Linux x86_64. Tool installation output is retained at
`/tmp/ic-auth-install-tools.log`; installation build output remains under
`.tools/rust/build/`. The repository-local formatting hook is enabled.
The added upstream helpers provide exact release-tag checks and byte-preserving
local lock-version transformation from the same adopted revision.

This starts A1 and the encoding portion of A3 without claiming either complete.
Protocol `Fleet` labels and signed domains remain unchanged. Auth role parsing
now validates at construction/deserialization; the host still owns trusted
identity projection and all authority. Remaining Canic consumer adaptation,
generated-Candid/feature coverage and canonical ownership convergence stay in
the tracker. Preserve Canic's current release boundary and keep its reinstall-only
policy out of wallet identity storage.

Focused validation passed: 17 tests across both packages, the three imported
Canic hash vectors, Candid identity/role byte compatibility, Wasm compile checks,
Clippy with warnings denied, locked metadata, transitive dependency boundaries,
formatting, snapshot integrity and local links. Initial Clippy validation found a
constant-size iterator lint; it was corrected and the check passed. No full CI,
PocketIC, live verification, service or downstream-adoption evidence is claimed.

The current local batch implements the maintainer-requested release/publication
commands, tracked by [IC Auth #1](https://github.com/dragginzgame/ic-auth/issues/1).
The shared runner now has working direct-delivery metadata and validation adapters
for patch/minor/major/resume. It retains complete-gate receipts and checks exact
selected commits, narrowly owned metadata, annotated tags and atomic branch/tag
delivery. Publication requires a clean, tagged, pushed release and verifies
crates.io archive checksums with retained intent before each upload.

Current focused checks cover real metadata transforms and local bare-remote
releases with a substitute complete gate, plus mocked registry/upload transport.
They exercise gate failure, staged source rejection, candidate conflicts, all
three increments, interrupted preparation, exact resume, dirty/untagged publish,
unknown registry state, checksum conflicts and lost-upload-reply reconciliation.
Fixtures and failed attempts remain under `target/release-tools.*/`. Package dry
runs use real Cargo and registry metadata, build both distributable crates and
abort upload. No live release or registry write is claimed by those checks.
Dependency pinning/root inheritance now pass against the tracked real lockfile;
formatting, locked metadata, shell/Perl checks, license copies, snapshot integrity
and local links are checked for this batch. The previous 17 auth tests remain
bootstrap evidence; no full CI or PocketIC run was added to this local tooling task.

Strictly offline attempts failed for unavailable registry metadata and Cargo's
staged-dependency checksum error; the first metadata fixture exposed yq's inability
to emit complete TOML. The implementation uses an explicit registry-aware dry
run and narrowly checked byte-preserving manifest edits. The interrupted-write
fixture also exposed an expected-receipt path error, which was corrected before
the recovery checks passed. Raw attempts are retained under `target/` and in
`/tmp/ic-auth-*-dry-run*.log` and `/tmp/ic-auth-release-tools.log`.

The pending `0.1.1` changelog carries the entire initial batch and new tooling.
It is the first patch increment from the committed `0.1.0` manifest, not a claim
of finalized `0.1.0` release history. There are no tags or published packages.
This command-implementation batch is uncommitted; it made no source push, live
release, package upload or deployment. See [development](../development.md) for
actual command effects, prerequisites and recovery boundaries.

Documentation closeout identified the wallet-service contract decisions explicitly
in the design: application identity scoping, credential linking/recovery, distinct
revocation semantics and exact public protocol limits. They do not block initial
Canic library extraction, but must be settled before supported wallet login.
